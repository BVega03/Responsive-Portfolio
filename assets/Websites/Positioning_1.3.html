            <p>I was set up. By the Brits. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. Family Love Michael.
                The only person that gets Lucille this excited is Gene. God knows they're squinters. I may have
                committed some light treason. Oh…yeah…the guy in the…the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy
                who doesn't make that in three months. Come on!</p>

            <p>I am going to my spin class. I thought you had vertigo. Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear. I
                didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear. We never had the chance to. ♪♪ Somewhere… over the
                rainbow… there's another rainbow… ♪♪</p>

            <p>I will be a bigger and hairier mole than the one on your inner left thigh! I figured out a way to make
                money while I'm working! Or it could be your colon. I'd want to get in there and find some answers.
                She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen.
                Steve Holt? The moron jock? I will pack your sweet pink mouth with so much ice cream you'll be the envy
                of every Jerry and Jane on the block!</p>

            <p>Heyyyyyy, Uncle Father Oscar. Now, do you wanna steer, or are you too old to sit on your Pop's lap and
                drive? Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. Her lawyers are
                claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's not even including Buster's Swatch.</p>
